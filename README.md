# Adv-in-Data-Science-Final-Project
Application of Deep Neural Networks in Diabetes prediction.

This is a final semester project wherein we will be using machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict whether the person has diabetes or not and identify important biomarkers. 

Following Techniques have been used
1. Random Forests Classifier
2. K-nearest neighbors classifier
3. Gradient Boosting Algorithm
4. Deep Learning Models
